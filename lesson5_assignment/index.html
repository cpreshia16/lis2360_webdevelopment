        <p> How much do you think is spent on advertising each year? 10 billion? 50 billion? 250 billion? Nope, it's &gt; 250 bilion. 563 billion is spent on advertising each year. And, that number is continuing to grow. We live in the Information age. We are continously being bombarded with information from internet, and we continuously transmit information to the internet as well. In fact, in 2016 1.1 zetabytes of data were transmitted. That's one TRILLION gigabytes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The enormous amount of data we recieve and transmit are
            monitored by large corporations such as Google,
            Facebook, Amazon, and Apple. This data is the monetized (to outperform competitors) after being analyzed using complex computer artificial intelligence algorithms,
            and used to serve perosnalized ads to increasingly fragmented audiences.
        </p>
