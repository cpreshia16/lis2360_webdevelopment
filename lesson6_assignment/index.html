        <h2>New Marketing Strategies</h2>
        
        <p> How much do you think is spent on advertising each year? 10 billion? 50 billion? 250 billion? Nope, it's &gt; 250 bilion. 563 billion is spent on advertising each year. And, that number is continuing to grow. We live in the Information age. We are continously being bombarded with information from internet, and we continuously transmit information to the internet as well. In fact, in 2016 1.1 zetabytes of data were transmitted. That's one TRILLION gigabytes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The enormous amount of data we recieve and transmit are
            monitored by large corporations such as Google,
            Facebook, Amazon, and Apple. This data is the monetized (to outperform competitors) after being analyzed using complex computer artificial intelligence algorithms,
            and used to serve perosnalized ads to increasingly fragmented audiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is still a human component in this, however, in the form of the older jobs such public relations specialists, advertising managers, market research specialists, etc. But, commonly you'll here of media, and advertising companies hiring social media influencers on sites such as Twitter & Instagram.

            According to Pixlee, 
            <blockquote>A Social Media ifnluencer who has established credibility in a specific industry. A social emdia influencer has access to a large audience and can persuade others by virtue of the authenticity.
            </blockquote>
            Companies are the customer, people are the products, and social media influencers are the salespeople.
